# USARIEM-thermoregulatory-web-application-front-end
A hand-coded, designed, and developed responsive web-based application to interface with several thermoregulatory response models with a key focus on SCENARIO model. This repository only contains the front end code of the project. Due to this, output graphs are set to display a random set of values. User input does not directly effect output.
